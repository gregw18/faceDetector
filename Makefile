# My attempt at a makefile that will work reasonably for my Learning OpenCV3 exercises and examples.
# Goals are to be able to change it as little as possible for each project, have it create binaries
# in one step, and to be able to have it automatically run Google Test unit tests for some exercises.
# Since these are simple projects, am putting obj files in current dir and binaries in bin.
